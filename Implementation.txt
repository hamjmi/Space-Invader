This is a simple HTML canvas game called Space Demo. 
It consists of enemies falling from the sky, and a player who must kill them by firing bullets to win the game. 
Player can move left and right using the arrow keys and can fire bullets using the space bar.

GameOver's when either player collides with any enemy or any 3 enemies crosses the player.
Scoring is also done.
Level is increased everytime when score gets increased by 200 which inturns increases the no. of enemy.
Speed of falling enemy is increased everytime when score gets increased by 400.

It Contains 2 type of enemy.
Enemy1 gives 10 points while Enemy2 gives 20 points.

When Game is over refresh the page to start again!

Variables used
	canvas: to refer to the canvas created.
	ctx: to store the context of the canvas.
	FPS: no. of frames per seconds used for the game
	score: to store the score collected.
	level: to store the no. of levels.
	count: to store the no. of enemies crossing the player.  
	myVar: to store the value returned by setInterval of game loop and is used to stop the game.
	myVar2: to store the value returned by setTimeout.
	limit: for controlling the amount of enemies are created.
	playerBullets: contains all the bullets.
	enemies: contains all the enemy of type 1.
	enemies2: contains all the enemy of type 2.

First of all Canvas is created with width=512px and height=480px. 
Set Score and count as 0.
Score is used for scoring and count is used for counting no. of enemies crossing the player.
Now the Game loop is created using SetInterval function with 30 fps and it will repeatedly call Draw and Update functions.
(setInterval : Used to create the game loop with 30 FramesPerSeconds)

Before explaining about Draw and Update function, we should draw player and enemies.

Instance of player is created at x:256px and y:350px & represented using sprite image of player.
	Shoot: function to create the bullet.
	Draw: to draw the player.
	Explode : to inactive the player after collision.

Function to create the bullets.
	Draw: to draw the bullets.
	Update: to update the x and y co-ordinates of the bullets. 

Function to Create an instance of enemy.It is same for both the enemy.
	Initially it is set to active and its pos is false.
	Its x-cordinate is set randomly using sin function.
	Draw: to draw the enemy when it is active & to draw the collision using concentric circle after collision.
	Update: to update the location of enemy at each frame interval.
			checking if it crosses the player, if yes the increase the value of count and pos is set true.
	Explode: to make explosion sound after collision.
	Speed: to increase the speed of the enemy

collides: Used to check if any 2 objects collide or not using simple rectangular collision detection algorithm.

HandleCollision:  for checking if enemy collides with either bullet or player.
	checks if 3 player crosses the player or not, if yes then call the stopMyFunction.
	for each bullet and each enemy check if they collides, if yes then explode the enemy,inactive the bullet, increase score and speed accordingly.
	for each enemy check whether they collided with the player, if yes then explode both and call the stopMyFunction.
	
Now we should see Update and Draw function that was referred in Game loop.
Draw: Background image is set on canvas.
	  Score and level is printed on top right corner of the canvas.
	  Player , every bullet and every enemies are drawn.

Update: checks if left and right key is pressed, if yes then move the x-cordinate of player accordingly.
	    checks if space is pressed, if yes shoot is called to create the bullet.
		call the update function of bullet and enemies.
		filter out all the active enemies and bullets.
		New enemies are inserted.
		HandleCollision is called.

Now we should see function to end the game.
	myStopFunction: Used to stop the loop using clearInterval and calling the function to print the game over frame.

Function to print the end frame.
	GameOver : Used to print the game over frame containing the score and other details.
